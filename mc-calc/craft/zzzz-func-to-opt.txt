all options (in --long form) that use a function;
use the function of the exact same name; so:

--trims -> trims()
--craft -> craft()

since i cant have `-` in function names, the exceptions are:

--trims-where -> trims_where()
--colors -> ccolor()

[all the dyes and all the trims]

i was utterly disheartened due to having to make these exceptions; alas, hope you don't care.

note: this file is sleepy (zzzz) so it remains last in the folder. don't bother it.
